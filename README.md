# sge-boilerplate

So, welcome to the sge boilerplate.
It stands for 'Software de Gest√£o Empresarial' - boilerplate.
In words other than my mother tongue. This is a boilerplate for Enterprise Management Software.

It uses the following packages:

hyn/multi-tenant
spatie/laravel-activitylog
spatie/laravel-backup
spatie/laravel-permission
nao-pon/flysystem-google-drive
doctrine/dbal

This is the core for a multi tenant solution with activity log and permissions.
There is a seeder wich creates multiple roles and permissions. Fell free to edit. And edit the CreateTenant command to match the name of your Admin Role.
